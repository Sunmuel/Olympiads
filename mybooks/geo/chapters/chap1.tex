\begin{lemma}{Three Tangents Lemma}{}
	Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle. Let $BE$ and $CF$ be altitudes of
	$\triangle{ABC}$, and denote by $M$ the midpoint of $BC$. Prove that $ME$, $MF$,
	and the line through $A$ parallel to $BC$ are all tangents to $(AEF)$.

\subsubsection{Shortlist 2010 G1}

\begin{problem}
Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $D, E, F$ the feet of the altitudes
lying on $BC, CA, AB$ respectively. One of the intersection points of the
line $EF$ and the circumcircle is $P.$ The lines $BP$ and $DF$ meet at point
$Q.$ Prove that $AP = AQ$.
\end{problem}

Let $\measuredangle$ denote directed angles mod $180^{\circ}$. The line EF meets
the circumcircle at two points. Directed angles allow us to treat both
at once, so we fix one of them.

Our goal is to show $\measuredangle PQA = \measuredangle APQ$, i.e., that $\triangle
	APQ$ is isosceles. We will first prove that $A$, $F$, $P$, $Q$ are concyclic.

Since $\triangle DEF$ is an orthic triangle, $\measuredangle CFA = \measuredangle
	ADC = 90^{\circ}$. Therefore, $FACD$ is cyclic, culminating in $\measuredangle
	ACD = \measuredangle AFD = \measuredangle AFQ$. However, $APCB$ is
cyclic, so $\measuredangle APB = \measuredangle ACB =
	\measuredangle ACD$. Thus, $\measuredangle APQ = \measuredangle AFQ$. Which
means that $AFPQ$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.

$FECB$ is a cyclic quadrilateral either, by the same $FACD$'s reason.
Therefore, putting together everything we've seen so far:

\[
	\measuredangle PQA = \measuredangle PFA = \measuredangle EFB = \measuredangle ECB
	= \measuredangle ACB = \measuredangle APB.
\]
Hence, $AP=AQ$.
